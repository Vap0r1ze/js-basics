// Strings

// Think of strings as a string of characters, or just plain text.
// Stings are denoted by 'single quotes' or "double quotes"
// But please refrain from using double quotes unless you really have to (which you shouldn't)

'These are all strings'
'Here is some text'
'Vap0r1ze'
'8882'
'If you want to put a single quote in here use a backslash to escape it'
'Like this \' '
'If you want a newline,\nYou can an escaped n'

// Examples:
'Welcome to vap\'s academy' // Welcome to vap's academy
'One line\nTwo line\nThree line\nFour'
/*
