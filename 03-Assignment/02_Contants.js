// Constants

// Constants are just like variables, except they cannot be set again
// Use the "const" keyword just like you use let to create a constant

const name = 'Vap0r1ze'
name + 'r' // 'Vap0r1zer'

// Things that will make error happens:
const name = 'Mephiles14' // Already declared a constant
name = 'learner' // You cannot set constants because their value must be "constant"
